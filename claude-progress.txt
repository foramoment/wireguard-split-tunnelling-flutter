## Session Log

### Session 1 - 2025-12-07 (Initializer Agent)
**Agent**: Initializer
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

**Work Done**:
- [x] Created project specification (app_spec.txt)
- [x] Created feature list with 75 features (feature_list.json)
- [x] Created agent prompts (initializer, coding, testing, ci_integration)
- [x] Initialized Flutter project with all platforms
- [x] Set up pubspec.yaml with dependencies:
  - flutter_riverpod (state management)
  - go_router (navigation)
  - hive + hive_flutter (local storage)
  - file_picker, google_fonts, logger, etc.
- [x] Created project structure:
  - lib/core/theme/ (AppColors, AppTheme - Material 3)
  - lib/core/router/ (AppRouter with go_router)
  - lib/screens/ (home, tunnel_details, add_tunnel, import_tunnel, split_tunneling, settings)
  - lib/models/, lib/services/, lib/providers/, lib/widgets/, lib/utils/
- [x] Created placeholder screens for all main views
- [x] Set up Material 3 theming with dark/light modes
- [x] Verified Windows build works (38.8s build time)
- [x] Initialized git repository with initial commit
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow with workflow_dispatch
- [x] Created CI trigger script for agent integration

**Files Created**:
- lib/main.dart - App entry point with Riverpod and Hive init
- lib/app.dart - WgClientApp widget
- lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart - Color palette
- lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart - Material 3 theme
- lib/core/router/app_router.dart - go_router config
- lib/screens/*/\*_screen.dart - 6 placeholder screens
- .github/workflows/build.yml - CI workflow
- scripts/trigger-ci.ps1 - CI trigger for agents
- docs/self-hosted-runner-setup.md - Runner setup guide

**Known Issues**:
- flutter_secure_storage, permission_handler, flutter_local_notifications 
  were disabled due to Windows build issues (requires additional VS components)
- Can be re-enabled later when needed

**Dependencies Disabled (temporary)**:
```yaml
# flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.4  # Requires C++/CLI
# permission_handler: ^11.4.0     # Mobile only
# flutter_local_notifications: ^19.2.0  # Add later
```

**Next Steps for Coding Agent**:
1. Implement Tunnel model (model-001)
2. Implement Peer model (model-002)  
3. Implement ConnectionStatus model (model-003)
4. Implement WireGuard config parser (tunnel-001)
5. Implement tunnel storage service (tunnel-002)
6. Build out the Home screen with tunnel list

**Notes**:
- App builds and runs successfully on Windows
- Empty state UI shows "No Tunnels Yet" with + button
- Theme switching works (system/dark/light)
- Navigation structure is in place
